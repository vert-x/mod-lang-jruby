  #
  # RouteMatcher also lets you extract parameters from the request URI either a simple pattern or using
  # regular expressions for more complex matches. Any parameters extracted will be added to the requests parameters
  # which will be available to you in your request handler.
  #
  # It's particularly useful when writing REST-ful web applications.
  #
  # To use a simple pattern to extract parameters simply prefix the parameter name in the pattern with a ':' (colon).
  #
  # Different handlers can be specified for each of the HTTP verbs, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.
  #
  # For more complex matches regular expressions can be used in the pattern. When regular expressions are used, the extracted
  # parameters do not have a name, so they are put into the HTTP request with names of param0, param1, param2 etc.
  #
  # Multiple matches can be specified for each HTTP verb. In the case there are more than one matching patterns for
  # a particular request, the first matching one will be used.
